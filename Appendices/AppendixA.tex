\chapter{The data-driven approach for a neural network training}
\label{appendix:data_driven}
The original paper by Metodiev, Nachman and Thaler \cite{Metodiev_2017} shows the idea of a data-driven analysis in details. In this chapter I want to introduce main concepts, necessery to understand how the proposed metode helps in week decays recosntruction.

In a classical approach to supervized machine learning, a model learns its properties usign sets of labeled data.
