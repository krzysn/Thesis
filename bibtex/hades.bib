It performs a search for Cherenkov rings of fixed diameter using the hit pattern information from the RICH detector. A complete pad plane is processed in less than 10μs with a ring finding efficiency greater than 90\%. In combination with the information from the other detector subsystems, an event reduction factor of about 100 is obtained by the second level trigger."

abstractNote = {Employing the Bonn–Gatchina partial wave analysis framework (PWA), we have analyzed {HADES} data of the reaction p(3.5{GeV}) + p → pK+Λ. This reaction might contain information about the kaonic cluster “ppK-” (with quantum numbers JP=0- and total isospin I =1/2) via its decay into pΛ. Due to interference effects in our coherent description of the data, a hypothetical K ¯NN (or, specifically “ppK-”) cluster signal need not necessarily show up as a pronounced feature (e.g. a peak) in an invariant mass spectrum like pΛ. Our PWA analysis includes a variety of resonant and non-resonant intermediate states and delivers a good description of our data (various angular distributions and two-hadron invariant mass spectra) without a contribution of a K ¯NN cluster. At a confidence level of CLs=95\% such a cluster cannot contribute more than 2–12\% to the total cross section with a pK+ Λ final state, which translates into a production cross-section between 0.7 μb and 4.2 μb, respectively. The range of the upper limit depends on the assumed cluster mass, width and production process.},

Σ0s were identified via the decay Σ0→Λγ with subsequent decays Λ→pπ− in coincidence with a e+e− pair from either external (γ→e+e−) or internal (Dalitz decay γ⁎→e+e−) gamma conversions. The differential Σ0 cross section integrated over the detector acceptance, i.e. the rapidity interval 0.5<y<1.1, has been extracted as ΔσΣ0=2.3±(0.2)stat±(−0.6+0.6)sys±(0.2)norm mb, yielding the inclusive production cross section in full phase space σΣ0total=5.8±(0.5)stat±(−1.4+1.4)sys±(0.6)norm±(1.7)extrapol mb by averaging over different extrapolation methods. The Λall/Σ0 ratio within the {HADES} acceptance is equal to 2.3±(0.2)stat±(−0.6+0.6)sys. The obtained rapidity and momentum distributions are compared to transport model calculations. The Σ0 yield agrees with the statistical model of particle production in nuclear reactions."
