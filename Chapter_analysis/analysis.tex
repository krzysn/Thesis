\chapter{PP data analysis}
\label{chapter:analysis}
The HADES collaboration has performed a proton-proton experiment with beam kinetic energy 3.5 GeV in September 2012. Data collected during this experiment has allowed to conduct a series of analysis devoted to hyperons' studies \cite{hades_inclL_35,hades_L1405,hades_L1520,hades_PWA_pKpL,hades_S1385}. In the following thesis the hyperon studies is extended by a $\Ls$ inclusive reconstruction. A research conducted with a four particles $\p \pim \pip \pim$ final state allows to reconstruct the $\Ls$ and  a $\Lz \Kz$ inclusive signals. The obtained results were compared with previous, exclusive measurements and used to constrain simulation of a new experiment devoted to hyperon studies \ref{chapter:simulations}.

All methods developed for pp@3.5 GeV experiment were also used for data collected during pNb@3.5GeV experiment. The detailed description of the pNb data analysis is in Ch. \ref{chapter:analysis_pNb}. 
\section{The pp @3.5 GeV experiment}

\subsection{The target and the trigger system}
\begin{figure}[hb]

  \label{fig:target}
\end{figure}


During the experiment a liqid hydrogen (LH2) target was used. The hydrogen was stored in a special tank designet to keep comstant tamperature 20K. Its length was 50 mm, what coresponds to interaction probability 0.7\% for protons with koinetic energy 3.5 GeV. The beam density reached $10^6$ particles/s. For data selection a two-level trigger was used. The first level trigger (LVL1) was dedicated to hadronic reactions and required at least three charged particles registered in META detectors. More over, to reduce a data flux only every third LVL1 event was recorded by DAQ system and stored for further analysis. During four-weeks experimental campaign in total $1.14 \times 10^9$ LVL1 events were recorded \cite{hades_inclL_35}. The second level (LVL2) was deditaced for di-lepton studies and bases on combined information from many detectors. The trigger system serch di-lepton pairs bases on information from: RICH detector (Cherenkov light rings), TOF detectors ($\beta>xx$) and pre-shower detector (electromagnetic cascade)\cite{Agakishiev:2009am,hades_DAQ}. In case of any signiture of a leptonic nature of the tracks they are saved without any downscaling.

Due to technical circumstances the pp experiment was conducted without the start detector. A time of fligh for each particle was calculated based on a difference between different paticles time of flight related to arbitrary experiment clock. Deatails of the reconstruction method are described in \cite{dybczak_phd}. However in following studies an information from TOF detectors was not required at all, so that information played only secondary role as and helped cross-check a de/dx identyfication metode.
\subsection{Absolute normalization}
\label{sec:normalization}
An integrated luminosity for the pp experiment was calculated using a pp elastic scattering [ref], it was
\begin{equation}
  L^{int}=3.13 \cdot 10^8 mb^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Thanks to a full scale simulation performed in HYDRA framework (for more details see chapter \ref{chapter:simulations}) it is possible to get a total detection efficiency for given reaction. The efficiency, together with known luminosity and a \cs allows for an expected count rate estimation, for any reaction.
\begin{equation}
  N^{\mathrm{expected}}_{pp\rightarrow X}=\frac{N_{\mathrm{detected}}}{N_{\mathrm{Simulated \; in \;} 4 \pi} \cdot 3} \cdot \sigma_{pp\rightarrow X} \cdot L^{int}.
\end{equation}
The factor 3 in denominator is connected with a trigger down-scaling. Due to limited read-out capabilities for hadronic channels each 3th triggered event was saved on tapes. A list of the reactions simulated for following analysis is prezented in tab. \ref{tab:channels}. 
\begin{table}

\section{Particles identification}
The HADES detector allows for two complementary methods of particles identification. The first, bases on particles' time of flight measured in the ToF detectors and particle's momentum measured in the MDC detector. The second method, bases on the MDC exclusively and uses combine information about particles' momentum and energy losses. The first one is favoured due to better precision, however a limited geometrical acceptance of the TOF detectors reduces detection efficiency by a factor 0.8 for each particle. In case of four particles final state, discussed in this thesis, a total loss caused by the TOF detectors  can reach 60\% of all detected particles. For that reason the $\frac{de}{dx}$ vs. $\p$ identification method was used. Ientification cuts have been optimized for previous analysis conducted by by HADES experiment and described in \cite{hades_inclL_35,lalik_phd}.Contours used for $\pim$ and $\pip$ are the same and differs only by electric charge.

  \caption{The identification cuts used in analysis - placeholder, figure from \cite{hades_inclL_35}}
  \label{fig:dedx}
\end{figure}


\section{Event selection}
Among all registered events only these containing at least four charged particles (two positive and two negative) was considered in analysis. They have been also observed events with more than four particles detected (fig. \ref{fig:mult}). They produces kombinatorics which are very difficult to control during further analysis. Because of that, only one four-particle combination from every event was taken. The combinations were ordered according to track reconstruction quality. For each combination the sum of $\chi^2$ for all tracks was calculated, and the best reconstructed combination was taken. 

Additionally an equivocation in $\pim$ selection requires an additional criteria to define which particle belongs to $\Lz$. Fortunately a $\Lz$ hyperon is a very narrow resonance what gives a natural criteria for $\pim$ classification. Within one hypothesis, both $pim$s were combined with a proton track and an invariant mass for those pairs ($\mathrm{M}^{inv}_{\p\pim}$) were calculated. The $\pim$ which gives better agreement with $\Lz$ pole mass was treated as originated from secondary vertex.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/mult.eps}
  \caption{Particles multiplicity for a final state wich requires two particles witch charge +1 and two with -1. It is visible that only in 54\% cases exectly four charged particles, were registered by detector. All cases with more than 4 particles requires some cryteria to take a proper combination from all possible. An asymetry between positively- and negatively-charged particles is caused by an initial state electric charge.}   
  \label{fig:mult}
\end{figure}

\section{Reaction kinematics}
\label{section:kinematics}
For pp@3.5 GeV collisions the production threshold for $\Ls$ ($E^{\mathrm{thr}}_{\p\Kp\Lz}=$) lies just below available energy ($\Sqs=$). Using the rule of a energy-momentum conservation is possible to calculate missing mass for observed particles. Because the analyzed final state is produced via reaction
\begin{equation}
  \p\p \rightarrow \p \Kp \Ls [\Lz \pip \pim],
\end{equation}
the smallest missing mass for the signal channel is $\Sqs - \Ls_{mass}= 1432$ MeV. It is a very strong kinematic constrain which separates well the signal from most of background channels. The missing mass spectrum is presented in fig. \ref{fig:missMass}. There is visible a resonance behaviour around 1200 MeV. Due to conservation rules missing particles have to have a total charge +2 and a baryon number +1. It leads to the conclusion that the missing mass spectrum is dominated by a $\Dpp$ production.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/missMass.eps}
  \caption{The missing mass of $\p \pim \pip \pim$ system. The resonance behaviour around 1200 MeV is clearly visible. The read line represents sum of signal (a Voigt function) and a background (5-th order polynomial) fit. Fitted Voigt function gives following parameters: $\bar{M}=1186$ MeV, $\sigma=61$ MeV, $\Gamma=$20 MeV.}
  \label{fig:missMass}
\end{figure}


Because in HADES energy regime almost all pions are produced via barionic resonances, and $\Dpp$s tend to be produced in pairs, it was expected that an invariant mass of $\p \pip$ detected in experiment would also contain a $\Dpp$ component. Indeed, as it is shown in fig. \ref{fig:dpp2D} most of the background comes from correlated source with mass maximum around double $\Dpp$ production. The figure shows also that a cut on missing mass > 1432 MeV removes a significant part of a background events. In case of $\Lz \Kz$ channel (see. \ref{section:LzKz}) the missing mass cut was put on a lower mass $M^{miss}_{\p \pip \pip \pim}>1077$. For details see fig. \ref{fig:dpp2D}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/Miss_PPip.jpg}
  \caption{The missing mass of $\p \pim \pip \pim$ system vs. invariant mass of a $\p\pim$ system. It is clearly visible that most of the background comes from correlated source of two $\Dpp$ production. Such situation helps to easy discriminate most of the background. Two red horizontal lines denotes minimal missing mass required for $\Ls$ and $\Lz$ production for $\p \pim \pip \pim$ final state.}
  \label{fig:dpp2D}
\end{figure}

\section{The $\Lz$ Reconstruction}
The next step of the analysis after a missing mass cut was an inclusive $\Lz$ reconstruction. In previous HADES experiments the reconstruction had based on a set of geometrical cuts. Their role was to increase signal-to-background ratio utilizing a $Lz$ decay geometry. Because the $\Lz$ decays via week interactions its lifetime is relatively long:$c\tau = 7.89 cm$ \cite{PDG}. That may be used to discriminate an out of target vertex from a background originates from a target.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/NN.eps}
  \caption{An architecture of a nural network used in analysis. For a simplicity only connections of the first neuron from the first layer were drawn. In dense network output from each of neurons is passed to every neuron in a next layer. A particular designed used for a $\Lz$ reconstruction consist of 4 layers: an input layer and 3 hidden. The network width (number of neyrons in one layer) was adjusted to a amount of input parameters and was 15.}
  \label{fig:NN}
\end{figure}

As it was shown in \ref{section:kinematics} an available phase-space for $\Ls$ production for a $E_k=3.5$ GeV is very limited. An inclusive analysis performed in \cite{hades_L1520} has measured ?? events of $Ls$ after all cuts. To improve statistics, and also examine new reconstruction methods in following analysis a neural network was used as a replacement of the geometrical cuts. Details about used method and an optimalization proces are explained in chapter \ref{chapter:NN}.

\begin{figure}[hb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/geometria_NN.eps}
  \caption{A graphical representation of variables used as an oinput for neural network.}
  \label{fig:NN_cuts}
\end{figure}


The final network archtecture used for $\Lz$ reconstruction is a feed-forward dense network with 4 layers, each N+6 neurons, where N is a number of scalar input parameters. For each neuron a sigmoid took role of an activation function. Because the network took role after geometrical cuts, as an input eleven geometrical variables had been taken:
\begin{itemize}
\item Distance between $\p \pim$ from $\Lz$
\item Distance between $\pip$ and $\pim$ from primaty vertex
\item $\Lz$ vertex cooridanes, reconstructed as a point of the closest aproach of $\p$ and $\pim$ tracks
\item $\Ls$ vertex coordinates, reconstructed as a point of the closest approach of $\pip$ and $\pim$ tracks
\item $\Ls$ vertex coordinates, reconstructed by tracking algorithm as a primary vertex
\item Opaning angle between reconstructed $\Lz$ vector and a line conecting primary and secondary verteces
\item Distance between $\p$ from $\Lz$ decay and primary vertex
\item Distance between $\pim$ from $\Lz$ decay and primary vertex
\item Distance between reconstructed $\Lz$ direction and primary vertex
\item Distance between primary and secondary vertexes
\end{itemize}


The optimized neural network enhanced a signal to background ratio from ??? without any cuts to ???. A $\Lz$ signal obtained in this way was used for a next steps of analysis: the $\Ls$ analysis (chapter \ref{section:Ls}) and associated $\Lz \Kz$ production (chapter \ref{section:LzKz});

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/L1116SB.eps}
  \caption{The $\Lz$ spectrum after a neural network analysis. The vertical lines denotes regions of a side-band analysis described in \ref{section:SB}. The data was fitted by a sum of 4-th order polynomial (blue line) and a Voigt function (green line. A very small value for $\Gamma$ parameter is caused by the $\Lz$ long live-time. Obtained $\sigma$ value describe an apparatus energy resolution. }
  \label{fig:L1116SB}
\end{figure}


\section{The $\Lz \Kz $reconstruction}
\label{section:LzKz}
Due to strangeness conservation low a $\Lz$ has to be produced with some anti-strange particle. The lightest candidate is a $\Kz$ meson, which decays in 69.2\% into $\pip \pim$ pair \cite{PDG}. For that reason a $\Lz \Kz$ signal is expected to be a significant part of the $\Lz \pip \pim$ final state and should be visible in analized data. Because a kinematics for a $\Lz \Kz$ production is different tahn for $\Ls$, the used missing mass cut was looser tahn in $\Ls$ analysis. It was set  $M^{miss}_{\p \pip \pip \pim}>1077$, what is a minimal missing mass expected for $pp \rightarrow p \Kz \Lz \pip$ reaction with $\p_{E_k}=3.5 \mathrm{GeV}$. 

After the $\Lz$ reconstruction two spectra were drown: a) a $\pip \pim$ invariant mass spectrum for events $1006<M^{inv}_{\p \pim}<1026$ and b) a $\p \pim$ invariant mass for $480 MeV<M^{inv}_{\pip \pim}<500 MeV$. Obtained specta have to were compared with simulation, so the same analysis chain was used to analyzed all channels listed in \ref{tab:channels} which contains associated $\Lz\Kz$ production. 

Using a procedure described in \ref{sec:normalization} the simulation was compared with experimental data (see \ref{fig:K0L0}). The simulation describes well a yield of $\Kz$ and $\Lz$ produced in experiment, although it does not describe the background shape. This is mostly caused by lack of reliable model for a double $\Dpp$ production. 

\begin{figure}[hb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.1 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/K0L0_indeksy.eps}
  \caption{The results for $\Lz \Kz$ associated production. Blue point represents experimental data, magenta a sum simulated channels. For both: the simulation and the experimental data a Voigt function was fitted. Than, a total signal yield between simulation and experiment was calculated.}
  \label{fig:K0L0}
\end{figure}



\section{The $\Ls$ Reconstruction}
\label{section:Ls}
The neural network analysis gives a data sample with good S/B ratio for $\Lz$ signal. However set of additional cuts has to be applied to extract a $\Ls$ signal from the data. Using the signal channel's simulation a set of hard cuts was optimized: i) a distance between a secondary vertex (SV) and a primary vertex (PV) has to be larger than 5 mm, ii) an opening angle ($\mathrm{OA}_\Lz$) between a reconstructed $\Lz$ momentum direction and line connecting the primary and secondary vertexes has to be smaller than ?? . The cuts are illustrated in fig. \ref{fig:Ls_cuts}. A $p \pim \pip \pim$ spectrum obtained after the hurt cuts contain both: a $\Ls$ signal and background originated from background under a $\Lz$ peak. To remove that contamination an additional steps were necessary. One of them was a side-band analysis which allowed to remove uncorrelated combinatorial background from $\Ls$ spectrum.
\begin{figure}[hb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/geometria.eps}
  \caption{Cuts used for a $\Ls$ reconstruction. They were optimized using simulation.}
  \label{fig:Ls_cuts}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Side-band analysis}
\label{section:SB}
A side-band analysis bases on assumption that a background kinematic changes slowly through a spectrum. Thanks to this, kinematics of the background events from signal region can be well described by background outside the signal region. In case of described analysis the side-band method was used to estimate an impact of non-perfect $\Lz$ reconstruction for the $\Ls$ spectrum. The fig. \ref{fig:L1116SB} shows input for the side-band. The $p \pim \pip \pim$ spectra for the signal and SB region after all the cuts are shown in \ref{fig:Ls_SB}. The side-band describes very well both wings of the data distribution. A difference between signal and the side-band spectrum can be interpreted as $\p \pim \pip \pim$ signal associated with the $\Lz$ signal.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/L1520_sig_SB.eps}
  \caption{The $\p \pim \pip \pim$ spectrum for events from signal region ($M_{\p \pim}^{inv}\in(1106,1126)$) -blue points, and from SB regions ($M_{\p \pim}^{inv}\in(1089,1106] \cup [1126,1143)$) - red points. Error bars shows a statistical uncertainty}
  \label{fig:Ls_SB}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cross-section extraction and differential analysis}
Despite the side-band spectrum describes a background shape very well, there is still some signal contamination in a mass region over 1540 MeV , see fig. \ref{fig:Ls_clean}. It may be caused by correlated combinatorial background, when a fake $\pip \pim$ pair is combined with real $\Lz$ signal. The main source of di-pion pairs, a $\Kz$ decay, is suppressed by a cut $M^{inv}_{\pip \pim}<410 MeV$. However there are reactions which allows for mixing pions from two different sources. Three of them were chosen as the most important ones. They are presented in tab. \ref{tab:channels} with numbers 3-5. the final state for each of them contains $\Lz$ and two different sources of pions. An combination of a $\pim$ from a $\Kz$ decay and a $\pip$ from a $\Dpp$ or a $\mathrm{\Sigma^+}$ creates an correlated combinatorial background.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/L1520_sig_Clean.eps}
  \caption{The $\Ls$ signal obtained in experiment. a) The experimental spectrum after a side-band subtraction (blue points) together with the signal and the background simulation (green and red line respectively). The magenta line shows the sum of all simulated channels. b) Signal after the simulated background subtraction. The Voigt functions used to describe the data points was constrained by a known $\Ls$ decay width $\Gamma=15.6 \mathrm{MeV}$ \cite{PDG}. Obtained $\sigma$ value can be treated as a measure of energy resolution obtained in the experiment.}
  \label{fig:Ls_clean}
\end{figure}

An identification of the background channels allows to simulate them and, together with a simulation of the signal channel estimate an inclusive \cs for $ \p\p \rightarrow \Ls \mathrm{X}$ reaction. The signal channel was simulated according to exclusive cross section measured by HADES$\sigma_{\p\p\rightarrow \p \Kp \Ls}=6.5 \mathrm{\mu b}$ \cite{hades_L1520}. Next the simulated signal spectrum was scaled up to get the same area under a simulation and experimental histogram. Finally, according to the obtained scaling an inclusive \cs is equal $\sigma_{\p\p \rightarrow \Ls \mathrm{X}}=7.1\pm 1.5 \mathrm{\mu b}$. A uncertainty comes from a statistical error.

The total yield of detected decays allows to conduct a simple differential analysis. A transverse momentum ($p_t$) and rapidity ($\Upsilon$) was calculated for each reconstructed $\Ls$. Obtained spectra are presented in fig. \ref{fig:WPt}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/WPt.eps}
  \caption{A rapidity and $p_t$ spectrum for $\Ls$ events. Error bars denote statistical errors. The esperimental data (blue points) is compared with the simulation (magenta line). A simulation is additionally decomposed into a signal channel (green line) and an combinatorial background (red line) contribution. Dashedd vertical lines show a mean values for $p_t$ and $\Upsilon$ distribution. }
  \label{fig:WPt}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Analysis of a $\pip \pim$ spectrum}
In simulation model used for the \cs extraction pions were emitted according to available phase-space. However it is possible that pion production occurs through a virtual $\rho$ meson. A possible $\rho$ contribution would manifest by a distortion of a $\pip \pim$ spectrum compared to direct production. An alternative simulation with the $\rho$ decay was also prepared and both of them compared with experimental data. The comparison between an experimental data and simulations is shown in fig. \ref{fig:pip_pim}.  
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/PipPim.eps}
  \caption{The $\pip \pim$ from emited from $\Ls$ events. The experimental data (blue points) is compared with signal (green line) and background (red line) simulation. A sum of simulated channels is shown by a magenta line. In the presented simulation a pahse space pions distribution was used. A result for pions produced by a $\rho$ decay is denoted by a green dashed line. }
  \label{fig:pip_pim}
\end{figure}
By naked eye an only-phase-space distribution describes data better. That was proven quantitatively making a linear combination of the two available spectra
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rho}  
  sum=N \cdot M^{inv}_{\pip\pim_{\mathrm{w/o}} \rho} + (N-1) M^{inv}_{\pip\pim_\rho},
\end{equation}
where $N \in [0,1]$. An agreement between data and simulation was tested by $\chi^2$ test. Its proved that within available errors the best data description is given by only-phase-space distribution of pions.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9 \linewidth]{Chapter_analysis/chi2.eps}
  \caption{A $\chi^2$ between simulation and data in function of N (see eq. \ref{eq:rho}). The N=0 refers for a situation when no $\rho$ contribution is present. It describes data the best, however due to signal statistics any N from 0 to 0.4 gives a good data description $\chi^2<1$.}
  \label{fig:chi2}
\end{figure}

\section{Systematic error studies}
The entire studies reduces data from ??? events to ???. Each of the cuts used for analysis may be a potenial source of sytematic uncertentities. Cuts have been waried to estimate this efect. Tab ??? contains set of possible sources of error.
