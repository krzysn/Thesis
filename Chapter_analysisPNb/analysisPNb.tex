\label{chapter:analysis_pNb}
Complemantary to a data from pp exerimewnt a pNb experimwnt was analized. As a result an inclusive \cs for $\Ls$ together with the reference state $\Lz \Kz$ were measured and compared to previous HADES studies \cite{hades_Sz_pNb,hades_Lp_femtoscopy_pNb,hades_arnold_pNb,hades_Ksi_pNb}. It allows to extend knowladge about hyperons in pNb reactions and to point a key diffrences in experimental reactions between proton-proton and pronon-nucleon reactions.
\section{Identyfication and data selection}
The used identyfication and selection algorithms were the same as in case of a pp data analaysis.
