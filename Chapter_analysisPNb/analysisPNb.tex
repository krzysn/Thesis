\label{chapter:analysis_pNb}
Complemantary to the pp exerimewnt a data from pNb experiment was analized. Mian scope of the studies was the same, aldough differences in physiscal sytuation has forced some minnor changes in used methods. As a result inclusive \css for $\Ls$ together with the reference state $\Lz \Kz$ were measured and compared to the previous HADES studies \cite{hades_Sz_pNb,hades_Lp_femtoscopy_pNb,hades_arnold_pNb,hades_Ksi_pNb}. It allows to extend knowladge about hyperons into a pNb reactions and to point key diffrences between proton-proton and pronon-nucleon reactions.
\section{Data from pNb experiment}
The p (3.5 GeV) +Nb  experiemnt took place in ???.


\section{Identyfication and data selection}
The used identyfication and selection algorithms were the same as in case of a pp data analaysis. However in proton-nucleus reaction it is impossible to directly use the energy-momentum conservation rule. They are two main obstacles: part of four-momentum may be transfered to the nucleus as a recoil and nuceons in nucleus are not in rest. All together prevents from a use of the missing mass cut. As a replacement a set of hard cuts was applayed.

\section{The $\Lz$ Reconstruction}
The main tool for $\Lz$ reconstruction stays the same as for in chapter \ref{chapter:analysis}. It is a neural network trained in a data-driven maner. Aldouth for a good signal extraction a set of additional pre-cuts was necessary. They are summerized in tab. ???

After applaying all cuts described in above table a signal~to~background ratio ??? was obtained. The result is shown in fig. \ref{fig:L1116SB_pNb}.
